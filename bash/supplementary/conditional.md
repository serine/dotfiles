## Conditionals in BASH

Conditional statements in BASH are very powerfull and useful to know.

`if [[ -f file ]]; then` check if true <br>
`if [[ ! -f file ]]; then` check if not true

- `-L` check if file exists and is a symbolic link
- `-f` check if file exists
- `-e` I think also check if file exists
- `-h` check if symbolic link exists

To get more help `bash test` command
